    Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
    Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
    Rage,rage against the dying of the light.<br>
    Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
    Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
    Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
    Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
    Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
    Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
    And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
    Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
    Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
    Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br>
        
    And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
    Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
    Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
    Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</article></div>
